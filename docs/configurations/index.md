# Configurations

## [Configure App Environment Variables](./environment-variables)
List of environment variables to configure the application ports, allowed origins, output folder and more are [here](./environment-variables).

## [Replacing a third-party binary](./replacing-third-party-binary)
Steps for replacing ``yt-dlp``, ``FFmpeg``, ``FFprobe``, and other third-party binary for your own binary or more recents ones are [here](./replacing-third-party-binary).
For example, if the latest Ongakuvault build includes a 4-month-old ``yt-dlp`` binary, updating it manually may resolve issues.
