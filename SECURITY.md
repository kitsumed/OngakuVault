# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please make sure that the security vulnerability you have found is possible in one of the following supported versions:

| Version          | Supported          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x (latest)   | :white_check_mark: |

**In case of doubt, if the vulnerability concerns the latest available version, report it.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Vulnerability reports will only be accepted if they are in English.**

Please use the [Github feature to report your vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability), avoid creating a public issue as this would make the vulnerability accessible to everyone without a patch.

In your report, **mention the application version** and **all the steps required to exploit the vulnerability**. Other media, such as a video PoC, are also appreciated.
If you have an idea for a possible solution to the vulnerability, don't hesitate to mention it in your report.

**If your vulnerability has been accepted and a patch applied, we ask you to wait at least 2 weeks before talking about it publicly**, (publish your PoCs and other information) so that users have a "safe-delay" to update their software.

There are currently no plans to distribute bounty, but I still want to thank you in advance if you do take the time to report your vulnerability.
